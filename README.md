To push from our local environment to GitHub, you can follow these steps:

1. Commit your changes using the `git commit` command.
2. Push your changes to the remote repository using the `git push` command.

Here's an example of the commands you can use:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "This is my first commit
git push
```
